## Instructions

Copy directly to the `/imagine[ ]` command. Don't wory about line breaks or spaces as they will be trimmed by the bot prompt. You should get one of the images bellow immediately but it might require 1 or 2 re-rolls.

To get different results use a different `--seed` or play around with other settings like `--c` and `--s`. Please consult Midjourney [Parameter documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list)

### Troubleshoot

- This prompt is intended to be used with MidJourney V4, so make sure that is the version you're using
- If you don't get the expected results even after a few tries, use one of the other seeds of the package.
- V4 has diferent [Upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers). You might want to try them to get the same result as the sample images.
