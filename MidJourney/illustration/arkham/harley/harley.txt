Close up portrait of the face of Harley Quinn in Arkham Asylum. ::5 

Rendered in a stunning fusion of painting and illustration techniques, Harley looks both Sociopathic and manic. With a mischievous, exaggerated grin, and wild deranged eyes, with dilated pupils, dark sinister background ::4 

Illustrated in mix of bright, acrylics, watercolors, ink splatters, to create dynamic, textured images that capture the psychological intensity and darkness of the villain. ::3 
The composition pushes the boundaries of the graphic novel form, distorted perspectives, jagged, expressionistic lines creates a sense of unease and disorientation, emphasizing the mental instability of the characters and the disordered reality of the asylum setting ::2
