"Hydrogen evolution from water electrolysis has become an important reaction for the green energy revolution. Traditional precious metals and their compounds are excellent catalysts for hydrogen production; however, their high cost limits their large-scale practical application. Therefore, developing affordable electrocatalysts to replace these precious metals is essential. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have shown remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution and garnered considerable interest in electrolysis."*


TMPs are a class of inorganic compounds that gained attention due to their unique properties and broad applications. These materials are composed of transition metals and phosphorus, which form various crystal structures with different catalytic and electronic properties.


One of the key benefits of TMPs is their high catalytic activity, which makes them useful in many chemical reactions. They are effective catalysts for various reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and electrochemical reactions. TMPs have also been used as catalysts for producing chemicals, such as ammonia, and in fuel cells for energy conversion.


In addition to their catalytic properties, TMPs have shown promise in various applications, including energy storage and conversion. For example, due to their high conductivity and excellent electrochemical performance, TMPs have been used as electrode materials in supercapacitors and batteries.


TMPs have also been used in water treatment, where they effectively remove heavy metals and other pollutants from contaminated water. Their high surface area and reactivity make them ideal for this application.


With further research and development, TMPs have the potential to provide innovative and sustainable solutions for many challenges faced by society.

"Only 1% of the earth's surface water is accessible drinking water, while one in 10 people struggle to access it."


Microbial electrochemical technology (MET) is foreseen as one of the nascent technologies employed for wastewater treatment with concurrent bioenergy recovery, biomass production, and CO2 sequestration. The METs are sustainable engineered systems that use microorganisms as a catalyst to harvest electrical energy by transforming the chemical energy present in biodegradable organic matter existing in polluted water or, under external electrical energy, synthesising different compounds biotically or abiotically.


However, there are some limitations associated with METs. The energy conversion efficiency of METs is relatively low compared to other bioenergy generation technologies, such as anaerobic digestion and combustion, limiting its scalability and economic viability. METs also have a high initial capital cost due to the complexity of the technology and the need for specialised materials and equipment, limiting adoption in low-income regions.


The technology is complex and requires expertise in multiple fields, such as microbiology, electrochemistry, and engineering, making it challenging to design, operate, and maintain efficiency.


Despite the limitations of METs, the growing interest in sustainable technologies and the increasing need for water and energy security are driving the adoption of METs.

Food waste can be a potential feedstock for generating various fine biochemicals, such as aromatic compounds, pigments, essential oils, antibiotics, and biolubricants. The production of food waste-derived fine chemicals is an eco-friendly approach due to the subsequent reduction in waste generation and maximum resource utilisation. These fine chemicals have high industrial value and significant utility as a sustainable resource.


The presence of nutrients in discarded food waste, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate, makes it a valuable feedstock for biobased conversions. Thus, in addition to #bioenergy production, converting food waste into products of high commercial value, such as #biopolymers, bulk and fine chemicals, enzymes, and surfactants, will provide low-cost and environmentally friendly materials.


Nevertheless, while we continue to develop innovative ways to transform #foodwaste, the priority is still preventing food from going to waste.

Essential Oils: Nature's ingredients that keep us safe 🌿


The most conventional method to eliminate microbes involves liquid disinfectants containing synthetic chemicals. Nonetheless, several adverse side effects have been described for this type of product, including increased allergies, sensitivity, development of microbiological resistance, and toxicity, many of which are caused by synthetic ingredients.


Alternatively, antimicrobial action can be achieved through natural components such as essential oils. We can already find products which include #essentialoils. Nevertheless, many do not show effective results. Thus, developing new formulations with better antiseptic capacity, based on and reinforced with natural extracts from specific plants, is necessary to obtain effective products in this field.


In a partnership with Prados Embalados and Universidade de Coimbra, Science 351 is developing different skin care products with controlled release properties of active ingredients based on essential oils rich in #thymol and natural plant extracts. This project intends to solve the problems of limited #antiseptic capacity and #sustainability of the materials used in the formulation of these products.
