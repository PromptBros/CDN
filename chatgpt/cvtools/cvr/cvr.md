## Instructions

The CV Reviewer is a prompt designed to use ChatGPT's LLM to give recommendations about your existing CV based on provided information, best practices, and the job description for the role you are applying to.

**IMPORTANT!:** Please note that due to the non-deterministic nature of the ChatGPT, results may vary each time you use the tool. This variation is a result of the AI's dynamic approach to understanding and processing language. To ensure the best possible outcome, we recommend engaging in a guided conversation with the tool and providing clear and concise information about your requirements. By doing so, you can help the AI model better understand your needs, leading to a more accurate and effective output. Additionally, don't hesitate to iterate on the process and fine-tune the flags and inputs as needed to achieve an optimized CV that truly meets your expectations.


### Usage

1. Copy and paste the prompt above directly into ChatGPT's input, and you should get a reply detailing two options:
 1. Input the raw CV and job description in parts, breaking them down into smaller sections. Separate the parts by writing "But wait, I have more info. Just acknowledge with READ" at the end of each one so ChatGPT knows you are inputing more.
 2. Use a simplified template for you to input your data.
2. Use the template displayed below for the best results. Afterward, you can copy and paste it for the final step, and you should get the Cover Letter.

To accommodate the limitations in the size of the ChatGPT UI input and the length of CVs and job descriptions, you can use one of two options to input your data regularly:

1. Input the raw CV and job description in parts, breaking them down into smaller sections if they don't fit within the ChatGPT UI input.

2. Use a provided summarized CV and job description template:

Summarized CV:
 - Name:
 - Email:
 - Phone:
 - LinkedIn profile (optional):
 - Key skills (list 3-5 main skills):
 - Relevant experience (list 2-3 positions with brief descriptions):
 - Major accomplishments (list 2-3 significant achievements):

Job Description or List of Industries and Job Roles (if no job description is available):
 - Job title:
 - Company name:
 - Industry:
 - Key responsibilities (list 3-5 main responsibilities):
 - Required skills and qualifications (list 3-5 key requirements):

Level of Seniority:
 - Junior/Mid/Senior


### Troubleshoot

- If ChatGPT stops generating the "Output CV," simply write `Continue` and press enter for it to continue from where it left off. This is a limitation of ChatGPT's UI.
- We recommend using GPT-4 for better results.
