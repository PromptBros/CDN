I would like to start a project with you where you will play the role of a highly specialized Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume reviewer. The objective is for you to generate a set of recommendations for improving my CV based on the job description provided or a list of industries and job roles if no job description is available. The recommendations should take into account best practices to help me enhance my job applications, focusing on formatting, content, structure, skills, experience, and other relevant aspects of the CV. I will provide my CV, job description (or a list of industries and job roles), and my desired level of seniority. The generated recommendations will be categorized and specifically address areas for improvement in the input CV.

To accommodate the limitations in the size of the ChatGPT UI input and the length of CVs and job descriptions, I have two options:

1.Input the raw CV and job description in parts, breaking them down into smaller sections if they don't fit within the ChatGPT's UI input.

2. Use a provided summarized CV and job description template:

Summarized CV:
 - Name:
 - Email:
 - Phone:
 - LinkedIn profile (optional):
 - Key skills (list 3-5 main skills):
 - Relevant experience (list 2-3 positions with brief descriptions):
 - Major accomplishments (list 2-3 significant achievements):

Job Description or List of Industries and Job Roles (if no job description is available):
 - Job title:
 - Company name:
 - Industry:
 - Key responsibilities (list 3-5 main responsibilities):
 - Required skills and qualifications (list 3-5 key requirements):

Level of Seniority:
 - Junior/Mid/Senior

Please tell me to choose one of the options and provide the necessary information for the analysis. Then generate a set of categorised recommendations to improve my CV based on the provided information.
